- Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen.
- Write a program that asks the user for her name and greets her with her name.
- Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.
- Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
- Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17
- Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives him the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n.
- Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.
- Write a program that prints all prime numbers. (Note: if your programming language does not support arbitrary size numbers, printing all primes up to the largest number you can easily represent is fine too.)
- Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. I counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.
- Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.
- Write a program that computes: 4\cdot \sum_{k=1}^{10^6} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{2k-1} = 4\cdot(1-1/3+1/5-1/7+1/9-1/11\ldots).
